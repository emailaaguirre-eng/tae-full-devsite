      "extendedBio": "Kimber Cross is an adaptive alpine and ice climber based in Tacoma, Washington, whose life and work embody her mantra: can't. will. did. Born with one hand, Kimber has become a trailblazer in the outdoor world—summiting Mount Rainier six times, completing the historic Kautz Route with a prosthetic ice tool, and now training for classic objectives in Alaska's wild ranges. A former The North Face Athlete Development Program member, climb leader with The Mountaineers, and National Board-Certified teacher, Kimber bridges grit, education, and inclusion with rare clarity.",
