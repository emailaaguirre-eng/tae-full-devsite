# ArtKey Demo Guide

## Customer-Facing Demo URLs (No "Demo" in URL)

For showing to potential customers, use these clean URLs:

### ✅ Professional Demo URLs:
- **`https://your-site.com/art-key/691e3d09ef58e`** - Clean, professional URL
- This is the standard portal URL - no "demo" branding anywhere

### Internal/Testing URLs:
- `/demo/artkey-691e3d09ef58e` - Convenience link (has "demo" in URL)
- `/demo/preview` - Device preview tool (for testing)

## What Customers See

When customers visit the ArtKey portal, they see:
- ✅ Your ArtKey title
- ✅ Your custom background (color/image/gradient)
- ✅ Your links and buttons
- ✅ Your images, videos, Spotify, guestbook
- ✅ **NO "demo" text anywhere**
- ✅ **NO branding or labels**

The portal is completely clean and professional - it looks exactly like the final product.
